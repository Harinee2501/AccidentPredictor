# **Road Accident Severity Prediction**

## **Problem Statement**  
Road accidents are a major public health issue, causing fatalities, injuries, and property damage worldwide. Predicting the severity of accidents based on key factors such as weather, lighting, and road conditions can help mitigate risks and improve road safety.  

**Solution:**  
This project uses **machine learning** techniques to predict the severity of road accidents based on relevant features from historical data, providing actionable insights for traffic management and safety improvements.

## **Project Idea**  

### **Features:**  
- **Predict Severity:** Classifies road accidents based on severity (e.g., minor, moderate, severe).  
- **Factor Analysis:** Considers key factors like road type, weather, and driver experience to make predictions.  
- **Balance Data:** Employs SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) to handle class imbalance.  
- **Evaluate Model:** Measures model performance with accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

## **Approach**  

### **Data Preparation**  
1. **Load Dataset:** Reads the cleaned accident dataset (`cleaned.csv`).  
2. **Feature Selection:** Extracts relevant features such as age, weather, light conditions, etc.  
3. **Target Variable:** Severity of accidents as the prediction target.  

### **Data Splitting**  
- Splits the data into **training (70%)** and **testing (30%)** sets for model evaluation.  

### **Preprocessing**  
- **One-Hot Encoding:** Encodes categorical features for compatibility with machine learning models.  
- **SMOTE:** Balances the dataset by oversampling minority classes to address class imbalance.  

### **Model Training**  
- **Pipeline:** Combines preprocessing and a **Random Forest Classifier** for seamless execution.  
- Trains the model on resampled data for improved generalization on imbalanced datasets.  

### **Evaluation Metrics**  
- **Accuracy Score:** Overall performance of the model.  
- **Confusion Matrix:** Breakdown of predicted vs. actual classifications.  
- **Classification Report:** Precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.

## **Results**  
The model provides the following evaluation metrics:  
- **Accuracy:** Proportion of correct predictions.  
- **Confusion Matrix:** Insights into classification errors.  
- **Classification Report:** Detailed performance metrics for each severity level.

  - **StandardScaler:** For feature scaling (if needed).  
  - **OneHotEncoder:** Converts categorical data into numerical format.  
  - **ColumnTransformer:** Applies transformations selectively to columns.  

### **Balancing Technique**  
- **Imbalanced-learn:**  
  - **SMOTE:** Synthetic oversampling for balanced class distribution.  

### **Modeling**  
- **Random Forest Classifier:**  
  - Ensemble-based algorithm for robust classification.  
  - Handles non-linearity and complex interactions effectively.  

### **Evaluation**  
- **Sklearn Metrics:**  
  - `accuracy_score`, `confusion_matrix`, `classification_report`.
